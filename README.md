Code limitations:
Student/Faculty Table files added as examples. Works without them as well and will create them itself.
If student/facultyTable file do not follow the same format - it will break program
Delete only works sometime. Was not able to figure out why - I copied the deleteNode funciton straight from class, 
and looked online for destructors when I made the BST. 
I only figured out how to do rollBack with copies of the BST - and I know you said not to use that. 
Sadly, I did not have time to figure out how to do it otherwise. The best I could think of is to write the rollback code
for the opposite of each command that changes the tree. However, I do freelance marketing work, and it is busiest now due
to holidays.
